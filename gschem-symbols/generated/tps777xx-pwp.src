[pins]
# tabseparated list of pin descriptions
# pinnr is the physical number of the pin
# seq is the pinseq= attribute, leave it blank if it doesn't matter
# type can be (in, out, io, oc, oe, pas, tp, tri, clk, pwr)
# style can be (line,dot,clk,dotclk,none). none if only want to add a net
# posit. can be (l,r,t,b) or empty for nets
# net specifies the name of the Vcc or GND name
# label represents the pinlabel. 
#	negation lines can be added with _Q_ 
#	if you want to add a "_" or "\" use "\_" and "\\" as escape sequences
